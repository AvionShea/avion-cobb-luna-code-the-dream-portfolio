      <p class="about-me">
        Greetings everyone! My name is <span class="highlight-text">Avion</span>. I am currently pursuing an Associate in Applied Science in Computer Science while also holding degrees in <span class="highlight-text">Advertising & Graphic Design</span> and <span class="highlight-text">Business Administration</span>. Once completed, I plan to continue on to a <span class="highlight-text">Bachelor of Science in Computer Science</span>. My career goal is to work at a startup or in the field of SpaceTech, FinTech, or DefenseTech as a <span class="highlight-text">software engineer</span> and
        eventually move into a tech leadership position, where I can contribute
        to building tools that make a real impact.
      </p>
      <p class="about-me">
        Right now, I’m gaining hands-on experience with <span class="highlight-text">JavaScript</span>, <span class="highlight-text">React</span>,
        <span class="highlight-text">Node.js</span>, and <span class="highlight-text">PostgreSQL</span>, and I enjoy learning how to build projects that
        solve everyday problems. I also <span class="highlight-text">volunteer</span> with organizations like
        Habitat for Humanity and Kramden Institute, which allows me to give back
        to the community while sharpening <span class="highlight-text">teamwork</span> and <span class="highlight-text">problem-solving</span> skills.
      </p>
      <p class="about-me">
        Outside of school and tech, I enjoy gaming, music, and riding my
        motorcycle. I’m excited to connect with classmates, collaborate on
        ideas, and grow together in this course. If you’d like to connect
        professionally, feel free to add me on
