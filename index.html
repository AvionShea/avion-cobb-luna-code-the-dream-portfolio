      <p class="about-me">
        Hi everyone, my name is Avion. I am currently pursuing an Associate’s
        degree in Computer Science and plan to continue on to a Bachelor’s in
        Computer Science. My career goal is to become a software engineer and
        eventually move into a tech leadership position, where I can contribute
        to building tools that make a real impact.
      </p>
      <p class="about-me">
        Right now, I’m gaining hands-on experience with JavaScript, React,
        Node.js, and PostgreSQL, and I enjoy learning how to build projects that
        solve everyday problems. I also volunteer with organizations like
        Habitat for Humanity and Kramden Institute, which allows me to give back
        to the community while sharpening teamwork and problem-solving skills.
      </p>
      <p class="about-me">
        Outside of school and tech, I enjoy gaming, music, and riding my
        motorcycle. I’m excited to connect with classmates, collaborate on
        ideas, and grow together in this course. If you’d like to connect
        professionally, feel free to add me on
